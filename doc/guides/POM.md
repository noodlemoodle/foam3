## POM - Project Object Model

## Purpose

The purpose of a POM file is to provide the information needed to build or execute a FOAM project. It is used by for both Web and NodeJS JS applications and for Java server applications.

For pre-packaged JS web apps, the tool genjs.js will read a pom and create a single .js file containing a minified collection of all required .js files.

For non-packaged JS web apps, the web app will download and process the POM directly.

For server-side Java apps, genjava.js will process to POM and compile the resulting body
of .java source files.

## POM Attributes

### name

### vendorId
Optional property which is used as the Maven <groupId> when generating a Maven POM. If not specified, then the name: property is used instead.

### version
Optional property which is used as the Maven <version> when generating a Maven POM. Is also used as part of the filename when creating foam-bin JS files.

### licenses
Specify license(s) to be included in the packaged JS binaries.
All licenses from sub-projects are included, with duplicates removed.

```javascript
licenses: `
  [2023] Acme Corporation
  All Rights Reserved.
`,
Or
licenses: [
  `
  [2023] Acme Corporation
  All Rights Reserved.
`,
`
  [2023] Our Authors
  All Rights Reserved.
`
]
```

### stages
Stages provides information about which source files should appear in each stage
of JS loading. If a file does not appear in stages:, then it defaults to the stage
specified by defaultStage:, which itself defaults to 0 if not specified.
The first stage to be loaded is stage 0 and is stored in the file named foam-bin-version.js.
Later stages are named foam-bin-version-stage.js.
The first 0 stage should contain all sources needed during your initial screen.
The second 1 stage should contain sources likely to be needed.
Later stages should include test or debug code, or code very unlikely to be needed.
The use of stages is optional, but restricting your 0'th stage to only essential
files helps with startup time.

Ex.
```
  defaultStage: 0, // redundant
  stages: {
    1: [
      "foam3/src/foam/u2/wizard/pom",
      "foam3/src/foam/graphics/CView",
      "foam3/src/foam/u2/AllViews"
    ],
    2: [
      "foam3/src/foam/core/debug"
    ]
  }
```

### setFlags
Flags can be set which will control which files are included and excluded.
The top-most setFlags: takes precedence over lower-level setFlags: from
sub-POMs. This allows the top-level POM to override sub-POM defaults.
```
  setFlags: [ u3: true, sql: false ]
```

### projects
List of sub-projects / POM's to be recursively loaded. Sub-projects are loaded before files:.
If you need a sub-project to be loaded after some files, then either move those files
to another sub-project which is listed before the dependent POM, or else you can list
a POM in the files section in the required position.

Like with files, individual projects can include flags: information which determines
when the project is and isn't loaded. (See below.)

### files
List of source files to be loaded.

#### flags

```
flags: "java"       same as   flags: [ "java" ]
flags: "java|web"   same as   flags: [ "java", "web" ]

flags: "web&debug"  same as
predicate: () => foam.flags.web && foam.flags.debug;

Can combine | and &:
flags: "java|web&debug"   (& is higher precedence)
```
The default value for flags is defined in foam.js as foam.defaultFlags, which is currently:
```
defaultFlags: {
  dev:   true,
  debug: true,
  java:  false,
  js:    true,
  node:  false,
  swift: false,
  web:   true
}
```

When not running from a packaged foam-bin (ie. not including -u in your build command line)
then you can specify flags on either the command-line or in the <script> tag that loads foam.js.

Allow flags to be set in loading script tag"
Ex.: <script language="javascript" src="../../../foam.js" flags="u3,-debug"></script>

In the URL flags can be set by assiging them to either 'true' or 'false' as URL parameters:
```
http://somewhere.com/index.html?u3=true&debug=false
```

Flags can be specified to PMake with the -flags parameter. Ex.:
```
./tools/pmake.js -flags=web,java ...
```

Different build.sh targets alter the flags to include or exclude things like 'java', which is needed
when generating java source but not when generating the foam-bin.

The pmake command-line is parsed by processArgs() in processArgs.js. It sets flag values in both globalThis.flags
and foam.flags and reuses the flags for both Maker-dependent values like 'verbose' and 'loadFiles' as well as for
the traditional POM flags like 'java' and 'web'. Developers should be aware of the potential for naming conflicts.

#### predicate

A predicate can be supplied which should return true if the file is to be loaded.
This is useful for conditionally loading polyfills or for implementing logic more complex
than can be specified with & and | alone.

### javaDependencies

A list of Java Maven library dependencies.

### tasks

A list of POM-specific build tasks. Allow for adding new build tasks, overwriting
existing tasks and defining before and after tasks.

### JSLib

Like adding a JSLib Axiom. Is read by POM() in foam.js in development mode and by the VirtualHostRoutingServlet when running from foam-bin.js.
TODO: Add support to VirtualHostRoutingServlet for loading JSLibs.
Warning: May be removed in famour of just using JSLib axioms in your models.
Ex.:
```
axioms: [
  foam.u2.JsLib.create({src: 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@4.4.2/dist/chart.umd.min.js'})
]
```
The advantage of using the JsLib axiom is that it defers the loading of the library until
the component that uses it is created.

## Example

```javascript
foam.POM({
  name: "acmeapp",
  vendorId: 'com.acme",
  version: '3.1.1',
  licenses: `
    [2023] Acme Corporation
    All Rights Reserved.
  `,
  tasks: [
    // call before `versions' task
    function before_versions() {
      console.log('---------- before versions');
    },

    // overwrite `versions' task
    function versions() {
      // call `myVersions' task
      myVersion();
    },

    // call after `versions' task
    function after_versions(build) {
      console.log('---------- after versions');
    },

    // define new task
    function myVersion() {
      // access to `JAR_OUT' env variable
      console.log('---------- my versions', JAR_OUT);
    }
  ],
  defaultStage: 0, // redundant
  stages: {
    1: [
      "foam3/src/foam/u2/wizard/pom",
      "foam3/src/foam/graphics/CView",
      "foam3/src/foam/u2/AllViews"
    ],
    2: [
      "foam3/src/foam/core/debug"
    ]
  },
  projects: [
    { name: 'acme/src/somepackage/pom' },
    { name: 'acme/src/someotherpackage/pom' },
  ],
  files: [
    { name: "acme.app.Foo",  flags: "js" },
    { name: "acme.app.Bar",  flags: "js|java" },
    { name: "acme.app.Demo", flags: "demo&ava" },
  ],
  javaDependencies: [
    'commons-net:commons-net:3.6',
    'xerces:xercesImpl:2.12.0'
  ],
  JSLibs: [
    'https://cdn.somecompany.com/link/v2/stable/lib.js',
    { name: 'https://acme.com/link/v3/stable/lib.js', defer: true },
    { name: 'https://somewhere.com/v4/stable/lib.js', async: true }
  ]
});
```
